I have a LeetCode problem 1: Two Sum. Please help me solve it with the following requirements:

1. **Problem Understanding**
   * Restate the problem in your own words.
   * Identify inputs, outputs, and constraints.
2. **Approach**
   * Explain a brute-force solution first, including time and space complexity.
   * Then explain an optimized solution (if possible), also with time and space complexity.
3. **Code Implementation**
   * Provide the optimized solution in Python.
   * Write clean, production-quality code with comments.
4. **Walkthrough / Dry Run**
   * Demonstrate the code with at least 1 example input from the problem statement.
5. **Test Cases**
   * Provide at least 3 test cases (including edge cases).
6. **Summary**
   * Compare brute-force vs optimized solutions.
   * Highlight key insights that make the optimized approach better.
