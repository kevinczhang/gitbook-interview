# Object Oriented Design

Object-oriented design questions require a candidate to sketch out the classes and methods to implement technical problems or real-life objects.

**Object** package data and procedures that operate on that data. An object performs an operation when it receives a request from a client.

## How to Approach

### Step 1: Handle Ambiguity

Object-oriented design (OOD) questions are often intentionally vague in order to test whether you'll make assumptions or if you'll ask clarifying questions.

### Step 2: Define the Core Objects

Now that we understand what we're designing, we should consider what the "core objects" in a system are.

### Step 3: Analyze Relationships

Having more or less decided on our core objects, we now want to analyze the relationships between the objects.

### Step 4: Investigate Actions

At this point, you should have the basic outline of your object-oriented design. What remains is to consider the key actions that the objects will take and how they relate to each other.
