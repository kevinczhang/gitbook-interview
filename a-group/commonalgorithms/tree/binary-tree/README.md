## Types of Binary Trees

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary\_tree#Types\_of\_binary\_trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary\_tree#Types\_of\_binary\_trees)

A **full** binary tree is a tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children.

In a **complete** binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.

A **balanced** binary tree is a binary tree structure in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

A **perfect** binary tree is a tree with all leaves are at the same level, and every parent has two children.
