# Set Types

&#x20;There are currently two built-in set types, [`set`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set) and [`frozenset`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#frozenset). The [`set`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set) type is mutable, but  The [`frozenset`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#frozenset) type is immutable.
