# Overview

## Difference between a thread and a process

Processes and threads are related to each other but are fundamentally different.

A process can be thought of as an instance of a program in execution. Each process is an independent entity to which system resources (CPU time, memory, etc.) are allocated and each process is executed in a separate address space. One process cannot access the variables and data structures of another process. If you wish to access another processâ€™ resources, inter-process communications have to be used such as pipes, files, sockets etc.

A thread uses the same stack space of a process. A process can have multiple threads. A key difference between processes and threads is that multiple threads share parts of their state. Typically, one allows multiple threads to read and write the same memory (no processes can directly access the memory of another process). However, each thread still has its own registers and its own stack, but other threads can read and write the stack memory.

A thread is a particular execution path of a process; when one thread modifies a process resource, the change is immediately visible to sibling threads.

## Volatile&#x20;

If a variable is declared with the _volatile_ keyword then it is guaranteed that any thread that reads the field will see the most recently written value. The _volatile_ keyword will not perform any mutual exclusive lock on the variable.

As of Java 5 write access to a _volatile_ variable will also update non-volatile variables which were modified by the same thread. This can also be used to update values within a reference variable, e.g. for a _volatile_ variable person. In this case you must use a temporary variable person and use the setter to initialize the variable and then assign the temporary variable to the final variable. This will then make the address changes of this variable and the values visible to other threads.

## Deadlock

Deadlock can occur in a situation when a thread is waiting for an object lock, that is acquired by another thread and second thread is waiting for an object lock that is acquired by first thread. Since, both threads are waiting for each other to release the lock, the condition is called deadlock.

1. Mutual Exclusion: Only one process can access a resource at a given time.
2. Hold and Wait: Processes already holding a resource can request additional resources.
3. No Preemption: One process cannot forcibly remove another process' resource.
4. Circular Wait: Two or more processes form a circular chain where each process is waiting on another resource in the chain.

```java
public class SimpleDeadLock {

    public static final Object lock1 = new Object();
    public static final Object lock2 = new Object();
    private int index;

    public static void main(String[] a) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread1();
        Thread t2 = new Thread2();
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }

    private static class Thread1 extends Thread {

        public void run() {
            synchronized (lock1) {
                System.out.println("Thread 1: Holding lock 1...");
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(10);
                } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {}
                System.out.println("Thread 1: Waiting for lock 2...");
                synchronized (lock2) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 2: Holding lock 1 & 2...");
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private static class Thread2 extends Thread {

        public void run() {
            synchronized (lock2) {
                System.out.println("Thread 2: Holding lock 2...");
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(10);
                } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {}
                System.out.println("Thread 2: Waiting for lock 1...");
                synchronized (lock1) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 2: Holding lock 2 & 1...");
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
